# FPL-Analytics

For this project, I collected, cleaned, and preprocessed data for analyzing Fantasy Premier League (FPL).

FPL is a fantasy game where players select a team of players from the English Premier League and score points based on the actual performances of the players every game week. 
Players are restricted by a budget and are incentivized by the possibility of winning fantastic prizes and competing in mini-leagues against friends and colleagues. 
According to the official FPL website, it is the biggest game of its kind and is played by over 9 million players worldwide. 
The rules of the game can be found here https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules.

The Data was collected from publicly accessible FPL APIs, cleaned, and preprocessed in Jupyter Notebook while analysis and visualization were performed using Tableau.
A link to the dashboard is provided below while the Jupyter Notebook is contained in this repository. <br/>
